### Blind Stick Project - README

This smart blind stick helps visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles and providing alerts via vibration and sound. It also includes an SOS feature that shares the user's location via GSM.

### Features
- Obstacle detection with ultrasonic sensors
- Vibrating cap for directional feedback
- Buzzer alert for nearby obstacles
- Emergency SOS via GPS and GSM
- Remote location tracking via SMS

### Components
- Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors, GSM, GPS, Buzzer, Vibrating Motors, Emergency Switch

### How It Works
- Sensors detect objects and trigger vibrations and buzzer alerts.
- Pressing the emergency switch sends the user's location.
- Sending "hello" via SMS prompts an automatic location reply.

This project enhances safety and independence for visually impaired users.
